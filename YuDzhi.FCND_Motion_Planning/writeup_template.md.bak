# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`
These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes...
**plan_path()** method:
* setting home position
* retrieving current global position and converting it to current local position
* reading obstacle data
* creating grid and placing *start* - *goal* points on it
* A* path search implementation and subsequent wqypoints number minimizing

**planning_utils.py** library includes:
* `create_grid()` - grid representation of a 2D config space based on given obstacle data, drone alt and safety dist
* `Action` class - valid actions enumeration when moving through the grid
* `A-star` algorithm (2D, for grid representation) 
* `heuristic` function - for cost estimation in a-star

And here's a lovely image of my results (ok this image has nothing to do with it, but it's a nice example of how to include images in your writeup!)

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
Here students should read the first line of the csv file, extract lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and use the 
self.set_home_position() method to set global home. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.
1. Open data-file
2. Read and split the first line without \n: `line = f.readline()[:-1].split(",")`
3. Split each of two peaces to get float position values: `lat0, lon0 = [float(l.split(" ")[-1]) for l in line]`
4. Close file. 
Could be done with *pandas*, but this package isn't included in FCND-environment.

#### 2. Set your current local position
Here as long as you successfully determine your local position relative to global home you'll be all set. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.

1. Retrieve current global position `self.global_position = [self._latitude, self._longitude, self._altitude]`
2. Use `utm.from_latlon` in utility method global_to_local(global_position, global_home)
3. Convert Gl to Loc position `self.local_position = global_to_local(self.global_position, self.global_home)`

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
1. `def create_grid_and_edges(data, drone_altitude, safety_distance):
    """
    Returns a grid representation of a 2D configuration space
    along with Voronoi graph edges given obstacle data and the
    drone's altitude.
    """
    `
2. Create the graph with the weight of the edges set to the Euclidean distance between the points
        `G = nx.Graph()
        for e in edges:
            p1 = tuple(e[0])
            p2 = tuple(e[1])
            dist = np.linalg.norm(np.array(p2) - np.array(p1))
            G.add_edge(p1, p2, weight=dist)`

This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!

#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map 
and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.
*class Sample()* (extracts polygons from obstacle data) includes 
1. static method *random_sample* to sample 3D random Points
	
	goal_ne = Sampler.random_sample(data, TARGET_ALTITUDE, 1,False)

2. place random start and goal points on graph:

	north_min = Sampler.datalimits(data)[0]
        east_min = Sampler.datalimits(data)[2]
	start_v = (start_ne[0][0] - north_min, start_ne[0][1] - east_min)
        goal_v = (goal_ne[0][0] - north_min, goal_ne[0][1] - east_min)
        gr_start, gr_goal = start_goal_graph(G, start_v, goal_v)`

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

#### 6. Cull waypoints 
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.



### Execute the flight
#### 1. Does it work?
It works!

### Double check that you've met specifications for each of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) points.
  
# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.

And here is a lovely picture of our downtown San Francisco environment from above!
